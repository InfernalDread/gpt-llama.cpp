**Author:** Yue Yang

**Project Description:** Start the "Shortcut" through Siri to connect to the ChatGPT API, turning Siri into an AI chat assistant. You can speak your question directly to Siri, and Siri will answer you. Now our Siri has finally become intelligent and can talk to us fluently! And all this can be done with just a Shortcut and an API key.

**Author:** Significant Gravitas

**Project Description:** Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. This program, driven by GPT-4, chains together LLM "thoughts", to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.

_Note: Due to Vicuna generating worse responses than GPT-4, it doesn't work quite well right now._
